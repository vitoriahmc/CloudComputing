# Overview
 Vanilla is a powerful open source web-based forum. This charm will deploy
 the forum software and connect it to a running MySQL database. This charm
 will install the Vanilla files in /var/www/vanilla/
 # Installation
 To deploy this charm you will need at a minimum: a cloud provider,
 working Juju installation and a successful bootstrap. Once bootstrapped,
 deploy the MySQL charm and then this Vanilla charm:
     juju deploy mysql
     juju deploy vanilla
 Add a relation between the two of them:
     juju add-relation mysql vanilla
 And finally expose the Vanilla application:
     juju expose vanilla
